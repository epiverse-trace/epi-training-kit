## **What is EpiTKit?**

EpiTKit is a training strategy in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases and public health data science, developed by the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana as part of the Epiverse initiative. Its main goal is to provide open-access, multilingual (Spanish, English, and French) educational materials that are localized to the contexts of Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa, in order to strengthen regional capacities in data science and infectious disease modelling. . Additionally, it promotes gender equity in these fields to ensure a more inclusive and effective development in response to public health emergencies.

## **Epiverse TRACE: A Global Collaboration**

EpiTKit is part of an international collaboration that includes institutions such as the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and the Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom, the Medical Research Council Unit in Gambia, and data.org, with financial support from data.org and the International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada.

## **Motivation of EpiTKit**

Data science and mathematical modeling have become key tools to support the management and response to public health emergencies. However, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the availability of educational materials in Spanish remains limited, exacerbated by social, economic, and access barriers to quality open education. Additionally, there is a significant gap in the participation and representation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, especially in mathematical modeling, programming, and data science, which restricts the potential for advances in regional public health. In this context, EpiTKit emerges as an innovative e-learning strategy designed to overcome these barriers by offering high-quality open-access education through a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). Furthermore, it promotes gender equity in these fields, ensuring a more inclusive and effective development in response to public health emergencies in the region.

## **Objetive**

The main objective of EpiTKit is to provide open-access, multilingual (Spanish, English, and French) educational materials that embrace localism by adapting content to the cultural, linguistic, and epidemiological contexts of Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa. This approach aims to strengthen regional capacities in data science and infectious disease modelling through training that is both globally informed and locally relevant.

## **Target Audience**

EpiTKit is aimed at professionals and students in fields such as the health sector and STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as individuals involved in public health decision-making.

## **Content**

Currently, EpiTKit features a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that includes short learning units grouped into four main modules:

-   **Epidemic and Epidemiological Theory Module**: Addresses epidemic theory as a fundamental basis for understanding and managing infectious diseases from their history to the science behind them. This module provides the conceptual and analytical tools necessary to understand how diseases spread in human populations, evaluate their impact, and inform informed decision-making for their prevention and control.

-   **Data science in public health Module**: Covers the various stages of the data life cycle, such as data collection, extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This module focuses on acquiring or strengthening programming skills in the R language.

-   **Outbreak Response Module**: Presents the main knowledge and tools to effectively identify and manage infectious disease outbreak situations. This module includes elements of epidemiological surveillance systems, step-by-step outbreak investigations, effective risk communication, and the role of field and laboratory activities in outbreak response..

-   **Modelling and Analytics Module**: Presents theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and case studies for constructing mathematical models of infectious disease spread, exploring parameters, and statistical applications. This module allows the development of skills to apply advanced analytical techniques in interpreting epidemiological data and making informed decisions in public health situations.

Each of these modules is composed of several units. Each unit has an average duration of between 3 and 5 hours of work, depending on prior knowledge. This course is completely asynchronous and flexible in terms of time, allowing each student to manage their own learning pace. In the following image (Image 1), the modules and units are detailed, with the units already developed and currently available marked in light blue.

## **Work Phases**

The construction of this strategy was divided into four phases:

## **Exploratory Phase**

This phase took place from August 2022 to July 2023 and included analyzing the needs and challenges of the potential user community through in-person training sessions held in various cities across Colombia. During this phase, materials were created to test content and activities with different groups in five training sessions, which brought together **nearly 400 participants in five Colombian cities**: Bogotá (the capital), Bucaramanga (center-north), Cali (southwest), Manizales (center), and Quibdó (Pacific region). In total, there were **14 days and over 170 hours of in-person training**. A notable achievement of this phase was the participation of women, which exceeded 70%.

This exploratory phase allowed for testing content and activities, as well as identifying the needs and expectations of the user community through training sessions in major cities and intermediate cities with more difficult access and limited resources. These training sessions helped to adjust and refine the educational materials, ensuring their effectiveness and relevance for various contexts and needs.

These theoretical and practical training sessions included **keynote lectures, practical exercises in the R programming language, and practical workshops applied to public health**. In this way, the training sessions combined the acquisition of theoretical knowledge with its practical application, allowing for an understanding of the presented concepts, as well as the necessary skills to apply this knowledge in real situations and public health challenges.

The results of this phase showed that this strategy could be used to effectively support a Wide range of learners, including undergraduate and graduate students in health and STEM fields, as well as professionals, healthcare workers, and public health decision-makers. Given the diverse backgrounds and needs of this audience, we identified four distinct learner personas, which are distinguished by varying levels of expertise in programming, epidemiology, data management, public health decision-making, and modeling.

## **Design and Development Phase**

During this phase, carried out between March and November 2023, the initial units of the virtual course were developed. This phase included content creation and instructional design of the initial units. The instructional design process incorporated the needs and lessons observed in the Exploratory Phase to generate a more efficient, active, and engaging learning experience. Finally, this phase included the production of educational resources such as infographics, videos, podcasts, among others.

**In total, we created 57 educational resources**: 17 videos, including diagrammed videos, interviews with specialists, tutorials, and explanatory videos. Additionally, we created 10 animated diagrams, 15 interactive presentations, 2 infographics, 2 documents, 3 forums, 1 podcast, 3 R exercises, and 4 R challenges.

Furthermore, since the course adopts a comprehensive gender perspective in STEM and data science, it features the **use of inclusive language, balanced representation in images and voices, and a carefully developed graphic line to avoid the reproduction of stereotypes**. Additionally, the course highlights the contributions of historical figures of various genders, with the aim of inspiring students and fostering a more inclusive and equitable environment in these fields.
